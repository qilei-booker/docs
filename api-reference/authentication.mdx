## Getting Access

You can view your API quotas and request rate limits on the “[Account](https://i.threatbook.io/account)” page.

ThreatBook CTI now uses a single unified API key for all users. With this key, you can access different sets of APIs based on your subscription level:

- [**IP Report API**](/api-reference/enrichment/ip-report-v1)\
  Available to all users by default, with 50 free requests per day.
  
- **Premium APIs**\
  Includes endpoints such as [**Compromise Detection**](/api-reference/enrichment/compromise-detection-v1), [**IP Intelligence**](/api-reference/enrichment/ip-intelligence-v1), [**Domain Intelligence**](/api-reference/enrichment/domain-intelligence-v1), [**File Intelligence**](/api-reference/enrichment/file-intelligence-v2) and [**URL Intelligence**](/api-reference/enrichment/url-intelligence-v2). 
These require a premium subscription. If you’ve purchased Premium, your existing key will grant access.
  
- **Feeds APIs** \
  Feeds subscribers can use the same API key to access the specific data packages included in their subscription, such as [**IP Reputation**](/api-reference/feeds/ip-reputation) or [**IOC feeds**](/api-reference/feeds/ioc).
